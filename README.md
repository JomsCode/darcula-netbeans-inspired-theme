# Darcula Theme for VS Code (Inspired by NetBeans)

Hello! I'm Jom, and this is a VS Code theme I created based on the Darcula theme from NetBeans. I’ve always loved the clean and aesthetic look of Darcula, so I decided to bring that same vibe to Visual Studio Code.

## Why I Made This

I wanted a theme that is really eye comforting like Darcula from Netbeans but I couldn't find an exact match in the VS Code marketplace so I built on my own version inspired from Darcula NetBeans.

## How to Install

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for `"Darcula Theme - NetBeans Inspired"`
4. Click **Install**
5. Activate via `Ctrl+Shift+P → Preferences: Color Theme → Darcula Theme - NetBeans Inspired`
